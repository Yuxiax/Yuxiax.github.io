[Hi-ResNet: Edge Detail Enhancement for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10638169)

**Yuxia Chen**<sup>‚òÖ</sup>, Pengcheng Fang<sup>‚òÖ</sup>, Xiaoling Zhong, Jianhui Yu, Xiaoming Zhang, Tianrui Li

- The funnel module is proposed to reduce computing costs, efficiently extract high-resolution information, and avoid feature loss from the input image.
- The IA block is applied to a multi-branch module, integrating the dynamic global modeling capability of the Transformer into CNN-based networks.
- The CEA loss is developed to emphasize edge information while considering multiple classes.
- Hi-ResNet is validated on several benchmarks, achieving performance superior to existing prevalent methods.
